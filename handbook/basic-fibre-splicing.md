# Basic Fibre Splicing

## Overview
Fibre splicing is the process of joining two optical fibres end-to-end using heat. This guide covers the basic procedures for creating reliable fibre connections.

## Required Equipment
- Fibre splicer machine
- Fibre cleaver
- Stripping tools
- Cleaning supplies (isopropyl alcohol, lint-free wipes)
- Splice protectors
- Safety glasses

## Safety Precautions
⚠️ **Always wear safety glasses when working with fibre**
- Handle glass fibres carefully to avoid cuts
- Dispose of fibre scraps properly
- Keep work area clean and organized

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Preparation
- Ensure all equipment is clean and calibrated
- Strip the cable jacket to expose individual fibres
- Remove the buffer coating from fibre ends

### 2. Cleaving
- Use the fibre cleaver to make a clean, perpendicular cut
- Inspect the cleave quality under magnification
- Re-cleave if the end face is not satisfactory

### 3. Splicing
1. Insert fibres into the splicer alignment guides
2. Close the windscreen and run the splice program
3. Allow the machine to complete the fusion process
4. Inspect the splice for quality

### 4. Protection
- Apply splice protector sleeve
- Use heat shrink or mechanical splice protector
- Test the completed splice

## Quality Standards
- Splice loss should be < 0.1 dB for single-mode fibre
- No visible bubbles or contamination at splice point
- Proper fibre alignment confirmed by splicer

## Troubleshooting
- **High loss**: Check fibre cleave quality, clean fibre ends
- **Bubble formation**: Reduce arc power, check fibre preparation
- **Poor alignment**: Recalibrate splicer, check fibre condition

## Documentation
Always record:
- Splice locations and identifiers
- Loss measurements
- Date and technician name
- Any issues encountered
