# Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview
Systematic approach to diagnosing and resolving common field issues encountered during installations and service calls.

## General Troubleshooting Process

### 1. Information Gathering
- Document customer symptoms clearly
- Note when the issue started
- Identify any recent changes
- Check service history

### 2. Visual Inspection
- Examine all connections and cables
- Look for physical damage or corrosion
- Check grounding and bonding
- Verify proper cable routing

### 3. Signal Testing
- Measure signal levels at multiple points
- Test for noise and interference
- Check return path signals
- Document all measurements

### 4. Systematic Testing
- Test from outside to inside
- Isolate components one by one
- Use process of elimination
- Verify each repair step

## Common Issues

### No Signal/Service

**Symptoms**: Complete loss of internet/TV service
**Causes**:
- Cut or damaged cable
- Loose connections
- Equipment failure
- Service interruption

**Testing Steps**:
1. Check for area-wide outages
2. Test signal at demarc point
3. Verify connections at splitters
4. Test each cable segment
5. Check customer equipment

### Intermittent Service

**Symptoms**: Service works sometimes, fails randomly
**Causes**:
- Marginal connections
- Temperature-related issues
- Interference sources
- Equipment aging

**Testing Steps**:
1. Monitor over extended period
2. Check connections under stress
3. Look for correlation with weather/time
4. Test during peak usage hours

### Slow Performance

**Symptoms**: Service works but below expected speeds
**Causes**:
- Signal level issues
- Network congestion
- Equipment limitations
- Configuration problems

**Testing Steps**:
1. Test speeds at multiple times
2. Check signal quality parameters
3. Test wired vs. wireless
4. Verify service tier provisioning

## Advanced Diagnostics

### Signal Analysis
- **Downstream Power**: -15 to +15 dBmV
- **Upstream Power**: +8 to +58 dBmV
- **SNR**: >30 dB for reliable operation
- **BER**: <10^-9 for error-free transmission

### Sweep Testing
- Use spectrum analyzer for detailed analysis
- Look for ingress and interference
- Check amplifier response
- Identify problem frequencies

### TDR Testing
- Locate cable faults precisely
- Measure cable lengths
- Identify impedance mismatches
- Find water ingress points

## Safety Protocols

### Electrical Safety
⚠️ **Always check for AC power on coax**
- Use non-contact voltage tester
- Properly ground equipment
- Follow lockout/tagout procedures

### Ladder Safety
- Maintain three points of contact
- Check ladder condition before use
- Secure ladder at proper angle
- Never exceed weight limits

### Traffic Safety
- Use proper traffic control devices
- Wear high-visibility clothing
- Position vehicle safely
- Be aware of surroundings
